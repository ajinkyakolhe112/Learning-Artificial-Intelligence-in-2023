1. None of the Books & Courses are enough by themselves
2. Number of Required Courses is Very High and could be reduced

Thought Process of Selection
- Advanced courses should come later not before. ~~Hilton~~
- Choose 201 Level Courses
- Don't add duplicates
- Specifically add courses with different pov, even with same content
- Include Complimentary Visual Resources for understanding
- Practice Skills & Solving Problems
