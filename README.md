# Mastering Deep Learning & Computer Vision in 2023
- Deep Learning is made up of 2 major domains
  1. Computer Vision
  2. Natural Language Processing
- Why I choose **Computer Vision to learn first**
  - Because it's easier to see & understand images compared to numeric vector representation of a word in NLP's black box Neural Networks. 
  - Can use Neural Network Visualizations to understand the behaviour of the Neural Network better.
  - Why I chose **learn ONLY Image Classification in Computer Vision**
    - Image Classification is easiest problem to solve & understand in Computer Vision.
    - Being new to Deep Learning, I decided to focus on easiest problem & learn essential fundamentals first. Then learning more complex parts of Deep learning will become easier. 
    - **Steep Learning curve leads to very difficult journey or complete abondonment**.
- Lots Hands on experimentation with Pytorch & keras too (for easy to understand code)
- Building my own Code Cookbook for entire `Neural Network Ecosystem`, from network to it's visualizations

## 1. Summary
Found a lot of different learning resources from Internet. All Learning resources are [here](https://learn-ai-with-ajinkya.notion.site/learn-ai-with-ajinkya/Deep-Learning-Resources-Learning-Plan-Status-efc3c470f9ef495faf95dafd015ed810). Few good resources, fewer great resources & **Most are bad resources, avoid them**.

**Compile good courses from diverse POVs, not just a Single POV of Data Science.**
- Deep Learning needs a multi disciplinary POV - (Data Scientist + Neuroscientist + Programmer + Business Analyst). So we need to learn all of these not just 1 single POV
- Every course is biased because of Instructor's POV. So need diverse types of courses
